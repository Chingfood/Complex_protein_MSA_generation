This is the directory that produces the MSA for complex protein by concatenating two proteins MSA together based on their genomic distance and phylogenic distance.

Two proteins basic MSA is carried out by HHblits with Uniref30 library.

Two MSA is concatenated by the genomic distance library and phylogenic distance library. 

The genomic distance library is generated from Uniref30 library using code from Genomic_distance_library_generating

The phylogenic distance library is generated from taxonomy library from NCBI (taxdmp) using code from Phylogenic_distance_library_generating
